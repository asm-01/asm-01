I have experience with *Java* programming, but I haven't completed any popular courses or tutorial series completely to enhance my skills. Instead, I learned *Java* by reading random blogs and watching YouTube videos on the internet, so my learning path has been rather non-linear and may have missed some key concepts. Even though I write android applications, I don't have formal training in it. I've learned through trial and error, reading documentation, and seeking help from online communities. I also have some experience with *PHP*, *HTML*, and *CSS*, but my skills in these languages may be limited. *JavaScript* is not my strong suit and I have struggled with it in the past. However, I'm always open to learning and growing as a developer. I'm committed to continuously improving my skills and staying *up-to-date* with the latest technologies in the field, despite the challenges that may come my way.

Coding on an android phone

is like trying to paint a masterpiece with a toothbrush 

is like being stuck in traffic, you're going nowhere fast

is like trying to build a skyscraper with only hammer and nails

is the ultimate test of patience and perseverance
